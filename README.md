# Destroy the monument
DTM is a minimalistic team vs team Minecraft pvp minigame. The point is to destroy the other team's monuments (obsidians). Teams can attack, defend and strategize to win the game first. In all of its simplicity there's a lot of space for players to experiment and be flexible.

## History
This section is written by the original author Juho Tapio AKA Juubes. There have been a lot of developers and players making DTM the game it is today. More about them in the Thanks-section.

DTM got its start from a popular server avic.us somewhere in 2014. I used to play the game for hours and it's still nostalgic to think about the times. At some point I decided I wanted to code the game myself. It proved to be a long and forever evolving process.

In 2021 DTM seems to have hit the flat top of its developing curve. Only the most critical bugfixes are added. Life got in the way I guess. Other than that, anyone is free to make a pull request or fork the project!

DTM has been my personal project for testing different coding styles and libraries. For over five years this was the project I learned the most Java with. I hope the project is used to make little kids happy as it made me for a long time.

## Technical
You can setup DTM by building it with gradle and configuring MySQL. For now, the game has been made to fit the color format of Quut.io and contains only 4 hardcoded maps.
